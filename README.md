This is my repo for project 4
## How to use the app
In this project there are 3 Workflows to execute namely:
##### > Login.xaml 
##### > Add.xaml
##### > Update.xaml.

### Step 1: Login
Open the Login.xaml and simply run the code. This Login.xaml will automatically log into the website when it is executed. 
### Step 2: Create and read
Open the Add.xaml and run the code. Add.xaml will automaticallly read the data into datatables and then create the records on the web app.If the run was succesfull it will update the read and create test results
### Step 3: Update and delete
Open the Update.xaml and run the code. Update.xaml will automatically update each record and then delete the records.If the run was succesfull it will update the read and create test results
